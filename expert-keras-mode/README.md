A location for files EdgeImpulse example expert mode Keras files (.txt) format unless we can think of a better format.

Hopefully add a few comments, and name the file with the main type of model fomo, classify, sound, motion or something else relevant to what the model does.

examples

fomo-3-extra-layers.txt


Reminder to post the enitre Keras file, not just the relevant parts.
