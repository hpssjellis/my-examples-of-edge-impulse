This is my student index.html page that they put in a new folder on their Gitpages https websites.

They then download a WASM file from EdgeImpulse and unzipp the 2 files a .js and a .wasm file into the same Gitpage folder on Github.

When the index.html file is viewed from a web browser you can see how your impulse could interact with your webcam.
