That is not working weell so lets try tensoflowJS

The pre-designed gitpod for converting tensorflow to tensorflowjs is here   https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/Gitpod-auto-tensorflowJS-to-arduino

The bash file I used is ```edge-to-tfjs.sh``` and the output folder is ```for_tfjs_fomo``` which has the SHARD file and the JSON file

A html link to that folder is 

https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-of-edge-impulse/aug2022-keras/for_tfjs_fomo/model.json

Which might load up on a browswer tensorflowjs webpage


running https://netron.app/ on the new TFJS model gave this diagram, but trying to load the model in the browswer seems to have issues.
